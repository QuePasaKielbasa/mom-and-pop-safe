/* Mom-and-Pop-Safe was started in 2020 by three women with a passion for IT. 
All of us used to work for big corporations and we have dealt with countless 
cases of cyberattacks, which were possible to spot and prevent thanks to expensive 
software, skilled professionals within the company and proper training. 

The idea of Mom-and-Pop-Safe was inspired by Kasia's parents, who run a small bookshop 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic moved their sales online. For their business, and countless 
similar companies, a data breach could mean bankruptcy - and without the means of multinational 
corporations, the owners have a hard time ensuring their business is protected on all fronts. 
While not all small business owners are lucky enough to have a security-specialist-daughter 
who can help protect their family business from cyberattacks, we believe everyone has the right 
to focus on providing goods and services to their customers without losing sleep 
over the online security of their business. 

Enter Mom-and-Pop-Safe, a small business dedicated to making the Internet a safer place 
for other small businesses. We offer a wide range of services from security software 
and network protection to remote backup services, to Security Awareness trainings and consulting. 
Our mission is to provide a comprehensive array of security measures tailored to 
each of our clients' needs, which is why we offer <link to OUR SERVICES> three different options, 
designed to fit different types of businesses. And we calculate the costs based on the number 
of devices - so that any family-run shop or a freshly founded start-up can afford our services.

The Internet is not only for the big players. Why should cybersecurity be any different? */
