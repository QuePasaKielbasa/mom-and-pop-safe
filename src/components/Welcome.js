        At Mom-and-Pop-Safe, we understand that the Internet is not only for the big players. 
        Whether it's a multinational corporation or a small family business, any company can 
        become a target for cyberattacks. It is especially difficult to avoid for small businesses 
        who often times don't have the adequate resources and knowledge. 
        We believe that cybersecurity is crucial in running a business and we are here to help.
